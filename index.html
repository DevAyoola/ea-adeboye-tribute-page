				<h2>Ministry</h2>
				<hr />
				Adejare Adeboye joined the Redemed Christian Church of God in 1973 and
				served as an interpreter before he was ordained a pastor in the church
				by Pa. Josiah Akindayomi in 1975. He became General Overseer of the
				church in 1981. For three years, he filled the role part-time at
				Unilorin before giving up his university position to preach full-time.
				The church which was not well known before Adeboye became the General
				Overseer, has branches in about 198 nations as of (March 2017),
				including more than 14,000,000 worshipers in Nigeria. Adeboye has stated
				that he aims to put a church within five minutes walking distance in
				developing cities and five minutes driving distance in developed cities.
				Adeboye is considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel, a claim he
				does not deny, saying that "Pentecostals have such an impact because
				they talk of the here and now, not just the by and by while we have to
				worry about heaven, there are some things God could do for us in the
				here and now". He celebrated his 80th birthday in 2022, Adeboye's
				foundation donated eight dialysis machines to Wuse District Hospital,
				together with a reverse osmosis medical water purification system and an
				electrical generator.
